# Changelog

## Version 2.16.1

* UI fixes and corrections

## Version 2.16.0

* Major UI overhaul
* Backslash now ignores ansi escapes in session/test URLs, dealing with Jenkins' failure to properly
  linkify colored console outputs
* `report_test_end` on an ended test now does nothing
* Replication configurations can now be edited from the UI
* Backslash now supports the `report_reporting_stopped` API, indicating that client reporting ended
  prematurely

## Version 2.15.5

* Sessions dead due to fatal exceptions now show a much clearer indication in their sidebar
* Fixed replication progress indication

## Version 2.15.0

* UPGRADE NOTE: This version changes the docker-compose.yml used to deploy Backslash. Please update
  the configuration when performing the upgrade

  starvation of the UI responsiveness when lots of sessions report to Backslash at a high rate

## Version 2.13.0

* Backslash can now be configured to replicate test data to an external ElasticSearch service
* Added support for "starring" tests, saving them for later reference
* Session ends and keepalives now extend the last activity of the subjects they run on

## Version 2.12.0

* Backslash now supports reporting interruption exceptions to help determine what caused the session to be interrupted. When the sessions are reported with a compatible toolchain (for example, Slash >= 1.5.0), the session and test views will show the interruption exceptions and their contexts
* Added an option to display metadata values in an accessible location for tests and sessions
* Warnings are now deduplicated within sessions and tests, preventing DB bloat
* Added a view for test cases. This is planned to evolve into a suite management feature over the next releases

## Version 2.11.1

* Fixed handling of test timespan when the test starts and before a keepalive is received

* Sessions can have a TTL, automatically marking their discard date on keepalives and session ends
* Support reporting of remote and local SCM branches
